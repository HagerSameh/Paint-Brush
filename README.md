# Paint-Brush
Paint Brush is an Applet based application that enables the user to draw basic shapes with different colors. In addition the user should have the ability to clear all of the drawings or erase some parts of them. The user would be happy if the applications supported Undo operations and draw with different line strokes (dashed or dotted).
